## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data source (URL, file path, or synthetic generation)
- Imputation strategy (mean, median, iterative)
- Output settings

## Missing Data Strategies

Imputation methods:
- Mean/Median: Simple univariate imputation
- Iterative: Multivariate imputation using other features
- Group-based: Imputation within groups
- Indicator variables: Track missingness patterns

## Caveats

- By default, generates synthetic data with artificial missingness.
- Imputation strategy should match data characteristics.
- Missingness patterns may indicate data quality issues.
